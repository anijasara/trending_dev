# README

A simple Ruby on Rails application which lists all trending developers in Github by hitting an external API.

Pushed the working application into Heroku, URL : https://lit-castle-05833.herokuapp.com/

Manual

    Clone the repository
    Install gems with bundle install
    Run rails server in terminal
    
  TrendingDevsController is the base controller which handles the requests.
  
  TrendingDev is the model (app/models/trending_dev.rb) which hits the third party to get the json response.

Cheers!
